ideas to try next:

1) Implement an elo system for each team:
-Algorith could use previous season data to evaluate "strength" of a team
-Win rate last season, did they make playoffs, how far did they make it, etc.

Elo could be updated after every game. Each team is given a base elo of lets say 100.
After each game, depending on whether they won and by how much, elo can increase.

2) moneypuck.ccom
-download the game-by-game datasets for 2022-2025 seasons
-extract xG





alt_search_grid = {
    'n_estimators' : [50, 100, 200],
    'max_depth' : [9, 12, 15],
    'min_samples_split': [5, 10, 15]
}



GS = GridSearchCV(
    estimator = test_model,
    param_grid = alt_search_grid,
    scoring = ["accuracy", 'f1'],
    refit = "f1",
    cv = TSS,
    verbose= 4
)
