ideas to try next:

1) Implement an elo system for each team:
-Algorith could use previous season data to evaluate "strength" of a team
-Win rate last season, did they make playoffs, how far did they make it, etc.

Elo could be updated after every game. Each team is given a base elo of lets say 100.
After each game, depending on whether they won and by how much, elo can increase.
